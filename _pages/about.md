My name is Huanzhuo Wu, and I am currently a telecommunications researcher at Nokia in Munich, Germany. Prior to this, I held a research position at the Deutsche Telekom Chair of Communication Networks (ComNets) at TU Dresden, Germany. My primary research interests lie in Mobile Network Architecture and In-Network/Edge Computing, with a focus on 5G-Advanced and 6G technologies, with numerous peer-reviewed <a href="/publications/">publications</a>.
<!-- In addition, I am in charge of applying and managing <a href="/projects/">research projects</a> with leading research institutions and companies. -->
<!-- My current work includes contributing to <a href="/projects/">research projects</a>, and <a href="/teaching/">teaching/supervising students</a> of the faculty. -->

I completed my Ph.D. in Telecommunications Engineering at ComNets, TU Dresden, from 2017 to 2022. Before that, I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science with honors from TU Dresden in 2016. During my studies, I gained practical experience through internships at BMW AG (2015) and Audi China (2016), and worked as a student assistant at TU Dresden. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Chang’an University, China, in 2011.
