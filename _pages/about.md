Welcome to my professional space!

I am a 5G/6G researcher at Nokia Standards in Munich, with a dedicated focus on advancing 3GPP network architecture, particularly in the areas of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) data collection, edge computing, and end-to-end user plane design. My work focuses on driving innovation for next-generation mobile networks, contributing to key 3GPP study and work items, and leading back-office efforts that help shape the future of telecommunications.

I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from TU Dresden, Germany, complemented by a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Chang’an University, China.

Throughout my industrial career and doctoral research, I have published numerous high-quality scientific articles and filed over 30 patents in the past three years. I actively contribute to the research community by serving as a reviewer and editorial board member for several respected conferences and journals in telecommunications.

Here, you can explore my latest contributions and achievements:
